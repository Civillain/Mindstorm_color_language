# Play
Play is a domain specific language for the Mindstorm EV3. 
The language elements are forward, backward, left, right and repeat.
The symbols for each are the five buttons on the fron of the controller.
The Play environment has a RECORD and REPLAY mode. In RECORD mode,
a child can enter commands by pressing buttons. These commands are recorded.
When the touch button is pressed, the robot switches to the REEPLAY mode. The sequence of commands is executed.
The child has created a small program, consisting of four basic steps, and a
flow construct, namely repeat.

In future versions, children can solve challenges, for example: let the robot drive
in a square in as few steps as posisble. This is an algorithm and 
abstract thinking is required to solve it. Children can thus play with their robot, and learn
basic algorithmic thinking.
